# Causal Question: 

What is the effect of having been bullied prior to age 12 on incidence of drug use in adolescence or adulthood?

## Specify a Causal Model

Our dataset:
  
- National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 
- Nationally representative cohort of youth age 12-16
- Initial recruitment n = 9000 in 1997
- In our final dataset n = 7703

<!-- Our data are from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. This was recruited as a nationally representative cohort of youth age 12-16 (initial n=9000) in 1997. These youth have since been followed longitudinally. The target population is youth in the United States. -->

## Original DAG
<!--This is the original DAG we developed while looking at what was available in the dataset: -->



\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{DAG Causal Final Project_all covariates} 


<!--While our initial DAG included sexual orientation, citizenship, and learning disability as covariates, we decided to exclude them from our final DAG for the following reasons. Sexual orientation wasn't associated with our exposure/outcome, and strata were homogenous by sexual orientation (p=0.09). Upon inspecting the NLSY codebook, citizenship was actually county of birth, which is not the same underlying construct we were trying to capture with citizenship. Finally, learning disability  actually captured a learning or emotional problem, and we decided that the latter could be influenced by our exposure, being bullied, and thus excluded it.

Therefore, below is our final DAG for this analysis:-->

## Final DAG 

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{DAG Causal Final Project_reduced covariates} 



## Structural Equations
Our endogenous nodes include: $X = (W, A, Y)$, where $W = (W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, W_5)$ is the set of baseline covariates, $A$ is victim of bullying, and $Y$ is incident drug use.

Our background variables (exogenous nodes include): $U = (U_W, U_A, U_Y)$ ~ $\mathbb{P}_U$. We place no assumptions on the distribution $\mathbb{P}_U$.. We have not placed any restrictions on the functional form.

Our structural equations $\mathcal{F}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_1 &= f_{W_1} (U_{W_1}, W_3) \\
W_2  &= f_{W_2}  (U_{W_2}) \\
W_3  &= f_{W_3}  (U_{W_3}) \\
W_4  &= f_{W_4} (U_{W_4}, W_1) \\
W_5  &= f_{W_5} (U_{W_5}, W_1, W_2, W_3) \\
A &= f_A (U_A, W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, W_5) \\
Y &= f_Y (U_Y, A, W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, W_5) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Where $W_1$ = mother's education; $W_2$  = sex; $W_3$  = race/ethnicity;  $W_4$  = not living with both biological parents; and $W_5$  = BMI. 

## Target Causal Parameter

Our target causal parameter is the difference in the counterfactual probability of drug use if all kids were bullied prior to age 12, and the counterfactual probability of drug use if all kids were not bullied prior to age 12:

$$
\psi^F (P_{U,X}) = P_{U,X} (Y_1 = 1) - P_{{U,X}}(Y_0=1) = E_{U,X}(Y_1) - E_{U,X}(Y_0)
$$
where $Y_a$ denotes the counterfactual outcome under an intervention to set bullying status A = a. This target causal parameter is the average treatment effect (ATE), or causal risk difference. 

## Our Observed Data

A: Bullying before the age of 12 (asked in 1997)

Y: Incident drug use ("cocaine or other hard drugs") after 1997

Ws: Race/ethnicity, sex, BMI, not living with both biological parents, mother's educational status (all Ws were measured at baseline) 

Sample size: 7,703

The target population is youth in the United States.


## Link to the SCM

We assume that the observed data O = (W, A, Y) ~ $\mathbb{P}_0$ were generated by sampling n times from a data generating process described by the SCM. The statistical model $\mathcal{M}$ for the set of allowed distributions for the observed data is non-parametric.

## Identifiability

<!--If there were no independence assumptions, this would be our DAG:-->

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{DAG Causal Final Project_reduced covariates with Us} 


## Identifiability

<!--In reality, we believe there are no shared unknowns between Race or Sex with any other variables; therefore, this is what we think is most true for our DAG:-->

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{DAG Causal Final Project_reduced covariates with Us_reality} 

## Identifiability

<!--However, under this initial causal model the target parameter cannot be identified, because there are a large number of backdoor pathways. To block the backdoor pathways and create an identified target parameter, we would need to control for all of the endogenous covariates in our model, and would need to also add a series of independence assumptions for convenience (with the previously assumed shared unknowns shown below in grey). We think the shared unknowns represented by the grey dotted lines are less plausible than in the remaining cases of shared unknowns (remaining in blue), and allow us to make progress on the causal roadmap.-->


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{DAG Causal Final Project_reduced covariates with Us_convenience} 


## Identifiability

<!--We could improve the plausibility of these additional independence assumptions by identifying potentially shared unknowns and gathering data on them so they can be controlled for in the model. For example, income; social status; and access to fresh, healthy food are all examples of potential shared confounders of biological mother's education and BMI. If we measured those variables and controlled for them in our model, it would be more plausible to assume independence between the unknowns contributing to both of those nodes. 

Once these independence assumptions have been agreed to for convenience, we have d-separation and can proceed with our analysis using an identifiable target parameter, using the final DAG below.-->

## Estimand and Statistical Model
The target parameter of the observed data distribution (which equals the causal parameter in the augmented causal model $\mathcal{M}^{F\star}$) is the G-Computation formula:
![](estimand.png)<!-- --> 

This is our statistical estimand.



## Estimation: Unadjusted ATE & SuperLearner

- The unadjusted ATE = mean(Y|A=1 - Y|A=0) = 0.05

- We use SuperLearner for prediction in all models. 
  - Library: SL.glm, SL.glm.interaction, SL.glmnet, SL.bayesglm, SL.randomForest, SL.step, SL.mean, SL.loglinear
  - 5-fold cross-validation

## Checking for Practical Positivity Violations

- We tabulated exposure and outcome across all possible levels of our categorical variables

- Observations exist in every possible category of our variable set

- For our only continuous variable, BMI z-score (for age and sex), we looked at the distribution of BMI z scores in the two exposure categories

## Confidence Intervals

- For TMLE, used the robust method built in to the ltmle package

- For G-comp and IPTW we performed a bootstrap

## Results
<!--According to our analysis, the difference between the average counterfactual risk of drug use if everyone was bullied versus if no one was bullied is 0.04, causally interpreted to mean that if people are bullied they are about 4% more likely to use drugs later in life than if they are not bullied. This is a plausible finding, though we expected it to be even higher; it makes sense that we would see this in our data, however, because drug use is typically underreported due to social desirability bias, biasing our risk difference toward the null. 

Our G-computation estimator had the lowest ATE estimate but greatest precision of our three estimators at 0.039 (95% CI: 0.017 - 0.034). Our stabilized IPTW estimator had the highest ATE estimate and moderate precision, at 0.045 (95% CI: 0.018 - 0.084). Our TMLE estimator produced an estimate of 0.044 (95% CI 0.007 - 0.08), with lowest precision. Ultimately, these estimators appear to have performed similarly, with much overlap between the point estimate and confidence intervals of each estimator's ATE.

Our analysis includes a number of limitations. First, there were a number of covariates that were exogenous, which we would have measured and included had we been prospectively collecting data instead of using an existing dataset. As one important example of this, we did not have any information on parent drug use, which we would have wanted to control for as an important confounder in our model (for identifiability we also needed to assume no shared unknowns between bullying and drug use, where this would obviously have also fit). It is likely incorporated into our model as one of the shared unknowns of not living with both biological parents, and our outcome (drug use). Second, while the data were collected, we did not include any mental health variables as endogenous variables in our model, because the questions were extremely vague, and the temporality was unclear (i.e., we couldn't determine that mental health wasn't caused by exposure). Mental health is likely an important covariate to include in this analysis, potentially as a confounder or a mediator of the exposure and outcome. And third, the independence assumptions that we created out of necessity identify the target causal parameter were likely not correct, introducing confounder-based biased into our results.

The results of this analysis allow policymakers and school administrators to better identify youth who are at risk for starting to use drugs as a result of bullying, and provide them with additional services and social supports. It also supports the use of anti-bullying interventions in schools, as prevention of incident substance use later in life will also lead to a reduction in many of the adverse health outcomes associated with use of drugs.-->

According to our analysis:  

- the difference between the average counterfactual risk of drug use if everyone was bullied versus if no one was bullied is 0.04  
  
- __causal interpretation__: if people are bullied they are about 4% more likely to use drugs later in life than if they are not bullied

<!-- Causal Question Material:
The relationship between bullying and drug use has previously been explored. This association has been examined both among youth who are perpetrators of bullying and youth who are victims of bullying. A 2016 meta-analysis found that youth who bully are at least twice as likely compared with non-involved students to use drugs later in life (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.60-3.07). However, when adjusting for confounding variables, the adjusted summary effect size was markedly reduced to an OR of 1.41 (95% CI: 1.20-1.66), suggesting that much of the variation is explained by other contributing factors.$^1$


According to a 2012 paper, youth involved in bullying were more likely than students not involved in bullying to use substances, with bullying victims reporting the greatest levels of substance use.$^2$ Longitudinal analyses have shown that youth who experience mental or physical bullying, separately or in combination, were more likely to subsequently report use of substances (alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and inhalants). This finding held after controlling for baseline covariates (gender, grade level, ethnicity and substance).$^3$ 

Drug use in adolescence or adulthood has been associated with adverse health outcomes, such as substance use disorder, overdose, infectious disease acquisition, and other major medical illnesses. Preventing bullying victimization may have downstream effects by preventing substance use initiation.$^4$ 

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the relationship between bullying victimization and drug use using causal inference approaches. This study fills a gap in the literature by studying this question in a causal framework. -->
